Build Your Own Cheat Sheet is one of Codecademy's open-ended projects, in which it is encouraged to problem solve and utilize other resources, instead of being provided step-by-step guidance. The requirements were to create a reference cheatsheet that documented at least one HTML or CSS topic using one or more HTML tables with multiple columns to display the information. We also needed to utilize a custom color scheme and custom styles for any code, such as HTML tags.
